Lesson 1: Understanding Biodiversity - Our Living Planet's Treasure
Lesson Description:
This introductory lesson will immerse students in the concept of biodiversity, exploring its various levels and significance for species survival. Students will engage in activities that highlight the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem stability and begin to formulate questions about global environmental issues related to biodiversity.
Learning Goals:
Understand the concept of biodiversity and its importance for ecosystem stability
Recognize the different levels of biodiversity: genetic, species, and ecosystem
Develop inquiry skills by formulating questions about global environmental issues
Success Criteria:
Define biodiversity and explain its importance for ecosystem stability
Identify and describe the three levels of biodiversity
Create relevant questions about global environmental issues related to biodiversity
Guiding Questions:
What makes our planet so rich in life forms?
How does the variety of life on Earth contribute to the health of our ecosystems?
What global issues might be affecting the diversity of life on our planet?
Curriculum Expectations:
Science:
B2.2 Demonstrate an understanding of biodiversity as the diversity of life on earth, including the diversity of organisms within species, among species in a community, and among communities and the habitats that support them
B2.3 Describe ways in which biodiversity within species is essential for their survival
Social Studies:
B2.1 Formulate questions to guide investigations into global issues of political, social, economic, and/or environmental importance (e.g., child labour, dwindling oil supplies, ownership of and access to fresh water, climate change, food shortages, refugees, or natural disasters), their impact on the global community, and responses to the issues.
B2.2 Gather and organize information on global issues of political, social, economic, and/or environmental importance, including their impact and responses to them, using a variety of resources and various technologies (e.g., use spatial technologies, satellite images, and/or online image banks as part of their investigation into the diminishing of ocean reef life; gather accounts by inuit and northern first nations witnesses to the effects of climate change; find annual precipitation rates for a region to study the relationship between drought and famine; locate data about products that canadians import from countries that use child labour or other cheap labour; use interactive websites to find data and information about health issues facing specific countries or regions).
Suggested Activities:
1. Biodiversity Exploration Station
Set up stations around the classroom, each representing a different ecosystem (e.g., rainforest, coral reef, grassland). Provide images, fact sheets, and specimens (if available) showcasing the diversity of life in each ecosystem. Students rotate through stations, recording observations and discussing the variety of life forms they encounter.
2. Levels of Biodiversity Jigsaw
Divide the class into expert groups, each focusing on one level of biodiversity (genetic, species, ecosystem). Groups research their assigned level and create a visual representation. Regroup students to share their expertise, ensuring each new group has an expert from each level. Students teach each other about the different levels of biodiversity.
3. Global Issues Inquiry Web
Introduce students to a global environmental issue affecting biodiversity (e.g., deforestation). As a class, brainstorm questions about the issue on a large paper web. Guide students to formulate questions that address various aspects (political, social, economic, environmental) of the issue. Encourage students to make connections between different questions on the web.
Suggested Digital Resources:
National Geographic: Biodiversity - Comprehensive resource explaining biodiversity concepts. Teachers can use this to prepare for discussions and create simplified handouts for students. Search terms: "National Geographic biodiversity encyclopedia"
American Museum of Natural History: Ology - Interactive biodiversity activities for kids. Can be used as a station in the Biodiversity Exploration activity or for extension work. Search terms: "AMNH Ology biodiversity"
World Wildlife Fund: What is Biodiversity? - Clear explanation of biodiversity levels with examples. Teachers can use this to create visual aids for the Levels of Biodiversity Jigsaw activity. Search terms: "WWF what is biodiversity"
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Biodiversity - Information on global biodiversity issues. Can be used to introduce the Global Issues Inquiry Web activity. Search terms: "UN sustainable development goals biodiversity"
Google Earth - Interactive tool to explore different ecosystems globally. Can be used to enhance the Biodiversity Exploration Station activity or for virtual field trips. Search terms: "Google Earth"
Extension Activities:
Research Project: Students choose a specific ecosystem and create a detailed biodiversity profile, including examples of genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity.
Creative Expression: Design a "Save Biodiversity" campaign poster or digital infographic highlighting the importance of biodiversity and ways to protect it.
Field Study: Conduct a mini biodiversity survey of the school grounds or a local park, documenting and classifying the variety of living things observed.
